Pricing &amp; elasticity analysis using SQL, Excel and Power BI


This repository contains a comprehensive pricing intelligence report and supporting analysis, demonstrating the translation of advanced regression modeling into clear, commercially focused strategic recommendations.

The analysis provides an executive-level view of demand drivers, competitive landscape, and promotional effectiveness for a major retail entity.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To move beyond descriptive reporting and establish a data-driven framework for Price Optimization and Commercial Strategy. The objective was to quantify the market's price sensitivity and the impact of external factors to drive higher profitability.

ðŸ“Š Key Analytical Findings

The core of the analysis relies on an econometric model identifying the key drivers of unit volume. The findings reveal critical strategic implications:

Price Elasticity (E) = -2.56 |Highly Elastic. Demand is extremely sensitive; a 1% price increase results in a 2.56% volume drop. This necessitates precision in pricing decisions.

Competitor Influence = +2.49 |Dominant Sales Driver. Competitor pricing movements strongly correlate with our unit volume, emphasizing the need for real-time competitive monitoring.

Promotional Uplift = +13% |Highly Effective. Current promotional activities provide a significant volume boost, validating the investment in promotional events.

Segment Concentration = 49% Revenue |The Premium customer segment drives half of all revenue, making them the most critical target for value preservation and differentiation.

Strategic Recommendations

The insights derived from the model led to the following high-level action plan:

Implement Dynamic Competitive Pricing: Transition from static pricing to a rules-based system that automatically adjusts prices on key elastic SKUs to maintain a target price index, capitalizing on competitive volatility.

Optimize Promotional ROI: Perform a deep-dive on the 13% uplift to identify which specific SKUs and customer segments yield the highest margin-accretive return, refining the promotional calendar for maximum profitability.

Strengthen Premium Value Proposition: Develop non-price value strategies (e.g., bundling, loyalty rewards) to protect volume within the highly valuable Premium segment against market elasticity.
